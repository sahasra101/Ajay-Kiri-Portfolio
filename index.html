                <p>
                    My name is Ajay Kiri. I am a physician researcher with expertise in the medical sciences, biochemistry, molecular biology and website software development.  I am currently transitioning my career into the medical bioinformatic field and am actively a student in the University of Pennsylvania/Trilogy Full Stack Web Development BootCamp course. I have been using computers since I was 10 years old and have been a big fan of technology my entire life.  I have always wanted to learn how to code and develop software, and now to that end, I am making the jump into writing my own code rather than just being an end user. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have worked in a variety of fields including as a: salesperson in retail sales, chemist, biochemist, molecular biologist, research scientist, personal trainer, teacher / lecturer, attending physician, and acupuncturist.  I am also fond of several hobbies including cooking,health and fitness, traveling and volunteering. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am looking for a medical software developer position that will utilize my expertise in medicine and the research fields of biochemistry and molecular biology.  I am easily able to read scientific papers, attend scientific conferences and become up to date with current trends and stages of research development in a variety of fields.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have excellent communication skills and have done many presentations at the grand rounds levels and to laymen like patients and students.  I have worked on projects that have ranged from complex to straightforward and can handle management level and individual oriented tasks.  Please look through my CV / resume and also my software portfolio to see some of my past work.  Please feel free to contact me for further information.
